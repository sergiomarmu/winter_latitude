<br>
<br>
WinterLatitude puts at your fingertips all the information about the stations
closest to you, the app for lovers of winter sports and snow.
<br>
The application shows information of the different stations of the Spanish
Pyrenees in which you can practice winter sports, such as: skiing, Nordic
skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling routes.
<br>
You will also see the material available for each sport and the price they have
for rent in each station.
<br>
You can get specific information about the stations: the name, its location,
size, number of tracks, etc... Besides the time it will do in each one of them.
<br>
The location of each station will be visible through a map, in addition, a route
is generated from your current position to the selected station so that you can
go to it more easily.
